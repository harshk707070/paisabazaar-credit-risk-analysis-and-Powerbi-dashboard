# Paisabazaar Credit Risk & Banking Fraud Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer-level financial data from Paisabazaar to understand credit behavior, assess risk, and support data-driven lending decisions. The analysis combines Python-based exploratory data analysis with an interactive Power BI dashboard to deliver actionable business insights.

The objective is to identify key drivers of credit scores, segment customers by risk, and enable continuous monitoring of high-risk profiles through visual analytics.

## Business Problem
Accurate credit risk assessment is critical for financial service platforms to:
- Reduce loan default risk
- Improve approval quality
- Offer personalized financial products

Misjudging creditworthiness can lead to either risky lending or missed revenue opportunities. This project aims to strengthen credit evaluation using explainable, data-driven insights.
